# Day 1 – Virtual Lab Environment Setup



## Objective

Establish a controlled virtual environment for hands-on cybersecurity labs.



## Tasks

- Installed VirtualBox and Windows 10 VM

- Configured RAM, CPU, and storage

- Take baseline snapshots

- Observed system processes and users



## Why Virtual Machines Matter

Virtual machines provide isolated environments for security testing,

allowing analysts to safely observe system behaviour without damaging

the host machine.



## Outcome

A clean VM environment was created and snapshotted, ready for future security experiments.
